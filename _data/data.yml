    summary: |
      My name is Evangelos Keramidas and i am a third year undergraduate student in the Department of 
      Informatics of the Ionian University. I think of myself as an above-average student who is confident
      in his work and he is determined to finish something that he has started. I am often described as a 
      "nerd" because when i start a project , i want to learn more and more about the subject i am working on
      in order to make a perfect essay . I help those who need aid in a specific subject and i am eager to spend
      entire nights to help them learn and overcome their difficulties.
